# What is the Sega Channel Demo Cart No. 4?
As The Cutting Room Floor states it: "Demo Cartridge 4 was built on February 16, 1994 and dumped in 2009 by LocalH. By contrast, the earliest released version was compiled on October 1994. At this point, it can function, but mostly as a user interface mock-up. It's very barebones and is missing several features."
